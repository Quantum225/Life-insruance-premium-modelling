#Life Insurance Premium Modelling

Considers current age, mortality rate, and rates of improvement of mortality to calculate the distribution of life expectancies, using both a deterministic and simulation approach.
Then, using this data, visualise the distribution, obtain other data such as mean and quantiles, and calculate for an assumed constant interest rate, i, a fair annuity using both an NPV and EPV approach.

Note: This model assumes constant interest rates, constant rate of improvements, only considers discrete ages in years, no months or days, and doesn't take into account selective mortality and ultimate mortality, you would be able to input them in the model, but you would have to do so for each age.

This model IS able to consider cause-specific mortality, such as gender, smoking, and health status, by inputting mortality data into the model.
This does require you to have the data, though.
